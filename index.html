                          <p>Yes! According to Teresa Manucy, DVM, a veterinarian at VCA Fleming Island Animal Hospital, cats can recognize and differentiate their name from other household pets’ names. She says this recognition is likely due to positive reinforcement or a cat’s association of their name with attention, food, or play.</p>

                          <p>Usually, it is the result of anxiety or fear, which causes your cat to attempt to defend themselves, even if that means scratching you. Luckily, there are several ways you can counteract the problem. Helping your cat stay calm and avoid unnecessary stress can prevent future attacks.</p>

                          <h4>Cat Birthday Party Ideas Mew Can Do Meow</h4>
                            <p>You celebrate the birthdays of your other family members. Why should your fur-mily be any different? Many people throw a birthday party for their pets, both to mark milestones and make memories. You can have a lot of fun creating cat birthday party invitations, decorations, and games to ramp up the claw-some and make a meow-ficent and unforgettable party.</p>
                  
                          <h4>Birthday Cakes for Cats</h4>
                            <p>What is any birthday party without a cake? You wouldn’t serve your cat a traditional human birthday cake to your kitty (that would be an un-fur-tunate cat-astrophe), but there are special birthday cakes you can make just for Sir Paws-a-Lot. There are even recipes for cat birthday cake icing made of mashed potatoes and rice flour for an extra special touch.</p>
                            <p>Make a super-simple individual cat birthday cake with tuna, egg white, flour, and cheese, baked in a muffin tin. Bonus: the recipe makes two so you can enjoy one with your litter-al best buddy. You can even snazz it up with some shrimp cocktail garnish, and serve the rest to your human guests.</p>
                  
                          <h4>Cat Birthday Party Decorations</h4>
